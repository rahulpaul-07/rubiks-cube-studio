# Architecture

This document describes the high-level design of Rubik's Cube Studio. It is intended for
contributors and reviewers who want to understand how the application is structured before reading
the source.

## Overview

Rubik's Cube Studio is a client-side single-page application that lets users paint, scramble,
validate, and solve a 3×3 Rubik's Cube. The solver uses Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm via
the `cubejs` library. A Three.js-powered 3D preview renders the current cube state in real time.

The application is bundled with Vite and written entirely in TypeScript.

```

Domain modules are pure and have no dependencies on the DOM, Three.js, or the solver implementation.
The UI and rendering layers depend on domain types but never on each other.

`main.ts` acts as the composition root, wiring event handlers to state transitions and rendering
updates.

## Key design decisions

### State management

The application uses a reducer-style pattern (`reduceAppState`) to manage state transitions. All
mutations flow through a single function, making state changes predictable and testable.

### Solver loading

`cubejs` distributes its solver tables as CommonJS source. The `CubeJsSolver` adapter evaluates this
source lazily with a restricted `require` shim when the user first triggers a solve. This avoids
blocking initial page load with the ~300ms table initialization.

### Three.js lifecycle

`CubePreview` manages its own animation loop and pointer-based rotation. The class exposes
`update()` to synchronize sticker colors and `dispose()` to clean up WebGL resources when the page
unloads.

### Validation scope

The application validates facelet count, color balance, and center positions natively. It then
relies on the `cubejs` engine to perform full cubie-level validation (edge/corner permutation parity
and orientation) to catch physically impossible states.

## Testing

Unit tests cover the `domain/` and `app/` modules using Vitest. Tests are colocated next to source
files as `*.test.ts`. Run them with:

```bash
npm run test            # single run
npm run test:watch      # watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # coverage report
```

## Build and deployment

Vite produces a static bundle in `dist/`. The `render.yaml` file configures a Render Static Site
deployment. Any static hosting service can serve the output of `npm run build`.
